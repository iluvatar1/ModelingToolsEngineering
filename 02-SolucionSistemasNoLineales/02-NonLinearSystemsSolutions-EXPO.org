* Introduction to root finding
  [[file:images/roots.png]]
** A problem example : Bunge jumping  (From Chapra 2012)
   The velocity for a jumper is given as 
   $$
   v(t) = \sqrt{\frac{gm}{c_d}} \tanh \left( {\sqrt{\frac{gc_d}{m}}t} \right) .
   $$
   You need to find the critical mass $m$ such us the speed does not
   exceed $v = 36$ m/s after $t = 4$ s, for $c_d = 0.25$ kg/m. How to
   do it? 

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   Start by defining a new function, $f(m)$, such us 
   $$
   f(m) = \sqrt{\frac{gm}{c_d}} \tanh \left( {\sqrt{\frac{gc_d}{m}}t}
   \right) - v(t).
   $$
   Now your problem is to find the root of the function $f(m)$

** Graphical method
   The first approach is to plot the function $f(m)$ and find the root
   graphically. The following snippet shows you how to do that

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports code :results none
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns # this improves the figures aesthetics

from matplotlib import rc
rc('text', usetex=True) # use latex rendering

sns.set() # activate seaborn
sns.set_context("talk") # increase fonts and imporove look for a talk

cd = 0.25
g = 9.81
v = 36
t = 4

m = np.linspace(50, 200, 100) # 100 points between 50 an 200
fm = np.sqrt(g*m/cd)*np.tanh(np.sqrt(g*cd/m)*t) - v

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(m, fm)
ax.set_xlabel(r"$m$[kg]")
ax.set_ylabel(r"$f(m)$")
fig.savefig("images/fm.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : None

   #+REVEAL: split
   [[file:images/fm.png]]

** Exercise
   Plot the function on your computer and find the value
   for the mass. How much is $f(m)$ for that value?

   Do you think this graphical approach is useful?

* Bracketing methods
  #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column"  style="float:left; width: 70%">
  #+REVEAL_HTML: <p>   
  *General characteristics*
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </p>
  - This methods require that you define an interval where to find the
    root. 

  - There could be single or multiple roots, or no root at all. 

  - The initial guess for the interval limits are such the root is
    included. 

  - The convergence is slow but sometimes guaranteed.

  [[file:images/brackets-roots.png]] 
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>


** Bisection
   [[file:images/bisect-example.png]]

   For a single root, one has 
   $$
   f(x_l) f(x_u) < 0 .
   $$
   Therefore, starting from $x_l$ and $x_u$ one can refine them until
   the interval is very small. 
*** Pseudo-code
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    1. Define a given precision $\epsilon$ and a maximum number of
     iterations $N$. 
    2. Choose and initial $x_l$ and $x_u$. They must include the root
     ($f(x_l)f(x_u) < 0$). 
    3. Compute a root estimate $x_r = \frac{x_l + x_u}{2}$. If $|f(x_r)|
     < \epsilon$, stop and return $x_r$ as root. 
    4. If $f(x_l)f(x_r) < 0$, then $x_u = x_r$, else $x_l = x_r$. Return
     to point 3 until the maximum number of iterations.  
*** Graphical description of the bisection method $x_r = \frac{x_l + x_u}{2}$
    [[file:images/graphical-bisection.png]]
** Exercise 
   Implement the bisection method and solve the original problem for
   the mass. 
   
** False Position
   [[file:images/false-position-basic.png]]

*** New definition for $\ x_r$
   $$
   x_r = x_u - \frac{f(x_u)(x_l - x_u)}{f(x_l) - f(x_u)}.
   $$
** Exercise 
   Implement the false position method by adapting the bisection
   method (basically just change the computation of $x_r$). Compare
   with bisection to find the root of the mass function.
** Exercise 
   Determine the positive real root of $\ln(x^2) = 0.7$, (a)
   graphically, (b) using three iterations of the bisection method,
   with initial guesses of $x_l = 0.5$ and $x_u = 2$, and (c) using
   three iterations of the false-position method, with the same
   initial guesses as in (b).
* Open Methods
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  These methods require only a single starting point or two starting
  points that do not necessarily include the root. 

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  Generally, when an open method converges, it is usually much faster
  than a bracketing method. 
** Fixed point iteration
   The original problem $f(x) == 0$ is transformed into 
   $$
   x = g(x).
   $$

   Then you make an initial guess for the root, $x = x_0$, and you
   iterate as 
   $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$. 
** Exercise   
   For the function $f(x) = e^{-x} - x$ use the iteration method
   (either manually or by using a program), starting from $x_0 = 0.0$
   and performing 11 iterations. Fill/print the following data
   | iteration | $x_i$ | $f(x_i)$ |
   |-----------+-------+----------|
   |         0 |       |          |
   |         1 |       |          |
   |  $\vdots$ |       |          |
   |        10 |       |          |
   |-----------+-------+----------|
** Exercise 
   Compute the root of the mass function using the fixed-point method.

** Newton-Raphson
   The Newton-Rapshon methods are a huge family of very powerful
   methods employing for both scalar and vectorial non-linear
   equations. For 1D, the simple derivation is based on the estimation
   of a slope. 

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600 :style border:2px solid black;
   [[file:images/nr-basic.png]] 
   #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column"  style="float:left; width: 50%">
   $$
   f'(x_i)= \frac{f(x_i) -0}{x_i - x_{i+1}},
   $$
   $$
   x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}. 
   $$
   As you can see, this is also an *iterative method*. 
   #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

** Exercise 
   Implement the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the mass
   function and for the function $e^{-x} - x$. 

** Other methods:
   There are other methods, much more elaborated, like the secant
   method, Brent's method, Higher order Newton-Raphson formulas,
   etc. Implementing those methods  in a numerically stable and
   efficient way could take a lot of time, so for now it is much
   better to use the scientific python library.  
* Using =Scipy= for one- and multi-dimensional equations
  =Scipy= offers you the =root= method to compute the root for a
  (system) of equations very efficiently. Please go and red the doc at
  [[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html][Scipy root function doc]] . This work both for a single or a system of
  equations. 

** Scalar equation
  The following snippet solves the previous example using the =root=
  method:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both :results output
from scipy import optimize
import numpy as np

def fun(x):
    return np.exp(-x) -x

sol = optimize.root(fun, [0],  method='hybr')
print("Solution: ", sol.x)
print("f(x): ", fun(sol.x[0]))
print(sol)
  #+END_SRC
  
  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example

  f(x):  0.0

  #+end_example

** Multidimensional equation (you can also use =fsolve=)
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both :results output
from scipy import optimize
import numpy as np

# x is a list (x[0] = x, x[1] = y)
def fun(x):
    return [x[0]  + 0.5 * (x[0] - x[1])**3 - 1.0, 0.5 * (x[1] - x[0])**3 + x[1]]

sol = optimize.root(fun, [0, 0],  method='hybr')
print("Solution: ", sol.x)
print("f(x): ", fun(sol.x))
print(sol)

* Exercises 
** Scalar functions
   Compute the root for the following scalar functions:
   - $f(x) = \sin(\sqrt{x}) - x$, $x_0 = 0.5$   
   - $f(x) = x^3 -6x^2 +11x - 6.1$, $x_0 = 3.5$
** The bungee jumping again
   Plot the critical mass as a function of the coefficient $c_d \in
   {0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, \ldots, 0.9}$, such us the speed is $v
   = 36$ m/s after $t = 4$ s.

** Intersection on 3D objects (System of equations)
   /Ref: Kiusalaas, Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3,
   Example 4.8/
   Determine the points of intersection between the circle $x^2 + y^2
   = 3$ and the hyperbola $xy = 1$. Start from  $x = 0.5, y = 1.5$.

   The solutions are $\pm(0.618, 1.618)\times 10^{-3}$ and $\pm(1.618,
   0.618)\times 10^{-3}$. 
** System of non-linear equations 
   /Ref: Kiusalaas, Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3,
   Example 4.9/

   Solve the following non-linear system:
   $$ \sin x + y^2 + \ln z − 7 = 0 $$
   $$3x + 2y − z^3 + 1 = 0$$ 
   $$x+y+z−5=0$$
   Starting from   $(1, 1, 1)$. 

   The solution is  $[0.59905376 , 2.3959314 , 2.00501484]$
** Circle from points
   /Ref: Kiusalaas, Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3,
   Exercise 4-26/ 
   The equation of a circle is $(x−a)^2+(y−b)^2 =R^2$ where $R$ is
   the radius and $(a,b)$ are the coordinates of the center. If the
   coordinates of three points on the circle are 
   | x | 8.21 | 0.34 |  5.96 |
   | y | 0.00 | 6.62 | −1.12 |
   determine $R, a, b$

   $$y+x^2-1=0$$
   Plot both functions to verify gra[hically that you have found the
   roots.

     clientes.  
   - Hay que encontrar coordenadas para $k$ centros de distribución. 
   - Las coordenadas del cliente $j$ estan dadas por las coordenadas
     $(a_j, b_j)$. 
   - Hay una distancia máxima $R$ entre los clientes y los centros de

     distancia real (debe ser positiva) 
   $$\sqrt{(x_j - a_i)^2 -  (y_j-b_i)^2} = R - h_{ij}, \forall j, \forall i$$.

** Multi-dimensional system
   /E. Ward, Numerical Methods, Exercise 3-21/
   Consider the nonlinear system
   $$ f (x, y) = x^2 + y^2 − 25 = 0, $$
   $$ g(x, y) = x^2 − y − 2 = 0. $$

   Plot both functions. Compute the solution of the system and
   identify graphically the solution points. 
** Rocket
   The upward velocity of a rocket can be computed by the following
   formula: $v = u \ln m_0 − gt m_0 −qt$ where $v =$ upward velocity,
   $u =$ the velocity at which fuel is expelled relative to the
   rocket, $m_0 =$ the initial mass of the rocket at time $t = 0, q =$
   the fuel consumption rate, and $g =$ the downward acceleration of
   gravity (assumed constant $= 9.81$ m/s$^2$). If $u = 180$0 m/s,
   $m_0 = 160,000$ kg, and $q = 2600$ kg/s, compute the time at which
   $v = 750$ m/s. (Hint: $t$ is somewhere between $10$ and $50$ s.)

   The volume of liquid V in a hollow horizontal cylinder of radius r
   and length L is related to the depth of the liquid h by 
   V= r2cos−1 r−h −(r−h) 2rh−h2 L

   Plot h as function of $r \in [0.1, 5.6]$. 
** GPS - GLobal Positioning System                                 :noexport:
   E. Ward, Exercise 3-41
   (Global positioning system project) Each time a GPS is used, a
   system of nonlinear equations of the form $$(x−a_1)^2 +(y−b_1)^2
   +(z−c_i)^2 =[(C(t_1 −D)]^2$$ $$(x−a_2)^2 +(y−b_2)^2 +(z−c_i)^2
   =[(C(t_2 −D)]^2$$ $$(x−a_3)^2 +(y−b_3)^2 +(z−c_i)^2 =[(C(t_3
   −D)]^2$$ $$(x−a_4)^2 +(y−b_4)^2 +(z−c_i)^2 =[(C(t_4 −D)]^2$$ is
   solved for the $(x, y, z)$ coordinates of the receiver. For each
   satellite $i$, the locations are $(a_i,b_i,c_i)$, and $t_i$ is the
   synchronized transmission time from the satellite. Further, $C$ is
   the speed of light, and $D$ is the difference between the
   synchronized time of the satellite clocks and the earth-bound
   receiver clock. While there are only two points on the intersection
   of three spheres (one of which can be determined to be the desired
   location), a fourth sphere (satellite) must be used to resolve the
   inaccuracy in the clock contained in the low-cost receiver on
   earth. Explore various ways for solving such a nonlinear
   system. See Hofmann-Wellenhof, Lichtenegger, and Collins [2001],
   Sauer [2006], and Strang and Borre [1997].
