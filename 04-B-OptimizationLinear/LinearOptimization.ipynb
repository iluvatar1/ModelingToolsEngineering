    "# Linear optimization with scipy and pulp\n",
    "\n",
    "(This tutorial is heavely based on: https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/ and https://benalexkeen.com/linear-programming-with-python-and-pulp-part-1/ . For a more detailed introductio to linear programming check the Book: Operation research Applications and Algorithms, Wiston)\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear optimization techniques are related to _linear_ problems both in the objective function and the restrictions. Of course you can solve them using the more general scipy functions like `minimize`, except for particular cases like integer binary variables. Instead, for all these linear problems, it is much better to rely of libraries optimized for these situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear problems can also require integer values for some (or all variables). Those problems are called **Mixed integer programming** . A very special case is when one (or more variables) must be boolean, with values 0 or 1 only. Those **binary** problems are also  common in linear programming and are used, for instance, to decide if something must be build or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic technique used in linear programming is the simplex method. An equivalent one is the interior point method. Furthermore , there are variants for other problems with bounds and restrictions, like the brand-and-bound or branch-and-cut methods. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming  \n",
    "\n",
    "For linear problems with continuous variables, we will use scipy. But later, for integer or binary variables, we will rely on specialized external libs like [pulp](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/). Please install it using \n",

    "- The profit per unit are 20, 12, 40 and 25. \n",
