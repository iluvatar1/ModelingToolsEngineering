    "## The Python interpreter\n",
    "The python interpreter is very primitive and basically interprets commands as you type them. For example, you can type commands like```print \"Hello World\" ``` and expect the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is much more convenient to use the iPython super-enhanced interpreter, we will not focus here on the bare-bones python interpreter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## iPython\n",
    "iPython is, currently, the standard interactive interpreter. It has many advantages over the original python interpreter, like autocopletion of variables, tight integration with the system commands, history, easy documentation access, etc. **Exercise:** Please open an ipython console, by either going to the appropriate part on the Spyder IDE, or by open ipython through the Anaconda launcher. Type some commands there. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python scripts\n",
    "In general, interactive sessions are designed for fast testing and propotyping. But, if you want to store a group of commands for later use (a program), then ypu should save it on Python file, whose termination is ```.py```. **Exercise:** On the Spyder editor, type some commands and save the file with the appropriate extension. Then re-open it and run it. You can also load/run the file directly from ipython. You need to use the magic words ```%load``` or ```%run``` . Check the docs and do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## iPython notebook\n",
    "The ipython notebook is a very convinient way to store ipython commands, together with notes, figures, and results. Currently, you are looking at the result obtained from an ipython notebook. This is very useful for logs, instructions, manuals, and interactive programming. An ipython notebook is stored in ```json``` format, which allows to include not only instructions but also command results and even figures. To execute a given cell, you should use the combination shift+enter.  **Exercise:** Open an ipython notebook by using the anaconda launcher, and write some commands and some instructions. Save it. Re-open it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## IDE: Spyder\n",
    "You have already used the IDE Spyder. This is an integrated develompment environment which allows editing, running, debugging, etc. of simple and complex (projects) python files. We will use only the very basic but you should get familiar with Spyder to exploit it better.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other multiplatform solutions, like Canopy (free for academics) or Python(X, Y). Look at them on google."
